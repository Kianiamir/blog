One of its key features is the ability to set up rules that dictate how traffic is handled for specific domains and applications. In this guide, we\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through the process of bypassing the proxy for specific domains and apps, using the ChatGPT app and OpenAI-related traffic as examples.\nUnderstanding Shadowrocket Rules Shadowrocket uses rules to determine how traffic is routed. These rules can be configured to handle different types of traffic in various ways. Understanding the different rule types and how to use them effectively is crucial for managing your network traffic:\nDOMAIN: Matches an exact domain name. Use this rule when you want to target a specific domain without affecting its subdomains. For instance, setting a rule for example.com will not apply to sub.example.com.\nDOMAIN-SUFFIX: Matches any domain that ends with the specified suffix. This is useful for applying rules to an entire domain and all its subdomains. For example, DOMAIN-SUFFIX,example.com will match example.com, sub.example.com, and any other subdomains.\nDOMAIN-KEYWORD: Matches any domain that contains the specified keyword. This is a more flexible rule that can capture multiple domains containing the keyword, regardless of their exact structure.\nGEOIP: Matches traffic based on geographic location. This rule can be used to route traffic from specific countries through the proxy.\nPractical Examples DOMAIN:\nRule: DOMAIN,openai.com,DIRECT Applies to: openai.com Does not apply to: api.openai.com, sub.openai.com DOMAIN-SUFFIX:\nRule: DOMAIN-SUFFIX,openai.com,PROXY Applies to: openai.com, api.openai.com, sub.openai.com Does not apply to: openai.com.au, openai.org DOMAIN-KEYWORD:\nRule: DOMAIN-KEYWORD,openai,DIRECT Applies to: openai.com, api.openai.com, openai.org, anotheropenai.net Does not apply to: open-ai.com, example.com Understanding and utilizing these rules effectively allows you to optimize your network performance, enhance security, and ensure that specific types of traffic are handled according to your requirements.\nOption 1: Setting Rules for Specific Apps (ChatGPT Launcher in My Case) To set a rule for an app and not a website in Shadowrocket on macOS, you’ll need to use the application’s bundle identifier or process name to target the specific app traffic. Shadowrocket allows you to configure rules that apply to specific apps, bypassing or directing their traffic through the proxy as desired. Here’s how you can do it:\nStep-by-Step Guide Find the App’s Bundle Identifier:\nOpen the Terminal app on your Mac. Use the following command to find the bundle identifier of the app (replace AppName with the actual name of the app): osascript -e \u0026#39;id of app \u0026#34;AppName\u0026#34;\u0026#39; For example, to find the bundle identifier of the ChatGPT app, you would use: osascript -e \u0026#39;id of app \u0026#34;ChatGPT\u0026#34;\u0026#39; Configure Rules for the App:\nGo to the rules section in Shadowrocket. This might be under a tab labeled \u0026ldquo;Rules\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Configuration.\u0026rdquo;\nAdd a new rule to apply the custom proxy settings to the app using its bundle identifier.\nSince the bundle identifier for the ChatGPT app includes the keyword openai (e.g., com.openai.chat), the DOMAIN-KEYWORD rule for openai will route the traffic for the app directly as well.\nOption 2: Bypassing Proxy for ChatGPT and All OpenAI Traffic Across Browsers, Plugins, Apps, and APIs To bypass the proxy for the ChatGPT app and all OpenAI-related traffic on macOS, follow these steps:\nOpen Shadowrocket:\nLaunch the Shadowrocket application on your Mac. Access the Rules Section:\nNavigate to the rules section. This might be under a tab labeled \u0026ldquo;Rules\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Configuration.\u0026rdquo; Add a Domain-Keyword Rule:\nIn the rules section, add a new rule using the DOMAIN-KEYWORD type. Enter the keyword openai and set the action to DIRECT. This ensures that any traffic containing the keyword openai will bypass the proxy. Save and Apply the Rule:\nSave the configuration and make ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/optimizing-shadowrocket---bypass-proxy-for-specific-domains-and-apps/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"how-to-make-shadowrocket-bypass-proxy-for-specific-domains-and-apps\"\u003eHow to Make Shadowrocket Bypass Proxy for Specific Domains and Apps\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadowrocket is a powerful tool that allows you to manage network traffic on your macOS device efficiently.

Because using the official wikis of Hugo and your theme of choice (PaperMod in my case) might not be as straightforward for beginners.\nInstallation I\u0026rsquo;m using macOS. For installation instructions on other operating systems, check the Hugo installation page.\nTo install Hugo on macOS, I use Homebrew:\nbrew install hugo Creating Your Site I like my site to be stored in a directory called blog, but feel free to change the name as you wish:\nhugo new site blog Now that the directory is created, initiate a git repository in it:\ncd blog git init Choosing and Installing a Theme Hugo is installed, and now you need a theme. Choose one by searching through the web; my choice is PaperMod. You\u0026rsquo;ll need the GitHub link of the theme.\nTo create the site with a YAML configuration file (since PaperMod uses YAML):\nhugo new site blog --format yaml Note that if you follow the instructions in Hugo\u0026rsquo;s official GitHub wiki, the config file will be generated as a TOML file instead of YAML. You have to force the usage of YAML because the sample files of the theme are in YAML format and using them is a good starting point.\nTo install the theme:\ngit submodule add --depth=1 https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod git submodule update --init --recursive # needed when you reclone your repo (submodules may not get cloned automatically) git submodule update --remote --merge Finally, set the theme as PaperMod in your site config.

You can run your website locally and check the blank index page. In the terminal:\nhugo server Then open this link in your browser:\nlocalhost:1313 Adding Content To add posts, you can add .md files to the content directory or simply use this command as suggested by the official Hugo wiki:\nhugo new content/posts/my-first-post.md But before doing so, I highly suggest checking the archetype folder and the default.md file. One issue I noticed is that the default header for new content is in TOML while we forced the site to use YAML universally. This might not necessarily cause problems, but I prefer consistency throughout the files. My default.md file was like this:\n+++ title = \u0026#39;{{ replace .File.ContentBaseName \u0026#34;-\u0026#34; \u0026#34; \u0026#34; | title }}\u0026#39; date = {{ .Date }} draft = true +++ I changed it to this:\n--- title: \u0026#39;{{ replace .File.ContentBaseName \u0026#34;-\u0026#34; \u0026#34; \u0026#34; | title }}\u0026#39; date: {{ .Date }} draft: true --- Now you are more than ready to create new content:\nhugo new content/posts/my-first-post.md At this point, you have a fully functional site that works fine locally. For the next steps, you can host it on a server to make it accessible to everyone.

This concept was beautifully articulated by Stephen Covey in his book, Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. I still vividly remember the moments spent reading it. Not just for the sheer joy of it, but because it took me months to finish—I was really slow at reading English back then! 😑 Part of why I liked the content was its resonance with my own experiences; it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like a new strategy to adopt, but something I had already encountered in life. I fondly recall explaining the book, word by word, to my friend Amin while sitting in Saeb’s Garden.\nHowever, I\u0026rsquo;ve realized that the discussion on dependency, independency, and interdependency isn’t always clear or relatable to everyone. It\u0026rsquo;s not about complex mathematics or wizardry, but it seems some fundamental aspects of personality might be necessary to grasp these concepts. That’s why I’m sharing these thoughts here.\nOver the years, I’ve broached this topic with many people. If this were a scientific study, I could almost conclude that hardly anyone cared or understood. Even those initially interested soon lost pace and gave up.\nThis narrative is indeed sad, but the reason behind it is quite clear: such discussions don’t cater to the lower levels of Maslow\u0026rsquo;s hierarchy of needs. Simple, but there’s more to it. I believe as the economy worsens and people’s needs become more immediate, interest in morality-based guidance dwindles. What terrifies me is that as we drift away from moral foundations, achieving high-value individual and societal goals becomes increasingly difficult. We risk trapping our whole community in a detrimental loop. What will happen after two generations? A rich cultural heritage might lose its defining personality traits, and a great nation like Iran could face turmoil similar to what Afghanistan has experienced.\nHow many years would it take for Afghans to rebuild their country from scratch? Perhaps indefinitely. And what are the prospects for personal growth for the new generations in such a society? Perhaps negligible.\nI initially thought about tweeting on this topic, but here I am, having written a whole page instead! 😂 This will remain a public draft until I find the time to add a concluding section, further discussing the dynamic between givers and takers, as classified by Adam Grant.\nFor now, I highly recommend this clip (Note: the spoken language is Persian). 😇\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/going-far-or-fast/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLife, at its core, is founded on interdependency.

One day, I found it on sale on the Kindle Store and bought it without checking the rating and reviews on Goodreads. I wish I had!\nRobert Glazer is an award-winning CEO and entrepreneur. His interviews in multiple podcasts and magazines piqued my interest, leading me to believe his book would be equally insightful. Unfortunately, like many self-help books written by successful leaders, I found \u0026ldquo;Elevate\u0026rdquo; lacking in novelty and inspiration.\nThe book introduces a 4-principle framework for capacity building:\nSpiritual Capacity Intellectual Capacity Physical Capacity Emotional Capacity Upon skimming through the book and seeing this list, I had a feeling of déjà vu. Apart from a few quotes from notable figures in capacity building and personal growth, I hardly ever felt the urge to highlight anything noteworthy.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a brief overview of some key points from the book:\nHighlights Intro\nFor everyone who knows deep down they can be more.\nThis quote initially raised my expectations sky-high. I was ready to add Robert Glazer to my list of personal heroes. He begins with a story about his weekly newsletter, Friday Forward, and its unexpected success, hoping to hook readers for the chapters ahead.\nChapter 1: What Is Capacity Building?\nCapacity building is defined as:\nThe method by which individuals seek, acquire, and develop the skills and abilities to consistently perform at a higher level in pursuit of their innate potential.\nGlazer emphasizes that capacity building is about doing more of the right things, not just more things. He introduces the four elements of capacity building:\nSpiritual (understanding who you are) Intellectual (enhancing your ability to think and learn) Physical (improving your physical performance) Emotional (facing challenges and managing relationships) Glazer believes our growth is best when all four elements develop in tandem.\nChapter 2: Build Your Spiritual Capacity\nDon’t consider the word “Spiritual” as a religious term in the context of capacity building. It refers to understanding who you are and what you want most in life.\nCore values serve as guideposts for navigating life, and understanding them is crucial for growth.\nChapter 3: Build Your Intellectual Capacity\n“Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young.” —Henry Ford\nIntellectual capacity involves the ability to learn, plan, and execute with discipline. Improving this capacity starts with the belief that it can be improved.\nChapter 4: Build Your Physical Capacity\nGlazer discusses the importance of a healthy body on overall life quality, emphasizing good nutrition and sleep.\nChapter 5: Build Your Emotional Capacity\nThink about a race car. If your spiritual, physical, and intellectual capacities are the tools to design, build, and improve the car, your emotional capacity is your ability to drive it amidst other drivers and unexpected obstacles.\nHe underscores the importance of challenging oneself, gratitude, and maintaining meaningful relationships.\nChapter 6: Build A Better Path\nNothing particularly noteworthy was found in this chapter.\nEach chapter ends with an action plan for practical steps in capacity building. You might find these useful if you\u0026rsquo;re curious about specific techniques.\nMy Personal Conclusion: I gave this book a rating of 1 out of 5 because it failed to offer anything new or interesting. However, this might be due to my previous readings and high expectations from an author of Glazer\u0026rsquo;s caliber.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/no-elevation-here---a-review-of-robert-glazers-elevate/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t remember exactly how this book entered my to-read shelf.

My primary goal at this stage was to get familiar with the fundamentals. However, the amazing bootcamp by Colt Steele turned out to be much more than I ever imagined, and it\u0026rsquo;s the best programming course I\u0026rsquo;ve ever taken.\nThe course consists of 20 chapters, and believe me, you won\u0026rsquo;t reach the last part easily. The course is super rich in content, quite lengthy, and requires proper note-taking and practice. For note-taking, I used Notion, which is my first, second, and third choice for taking notes, including some code snippets. If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with Notion, you can find plenty of YouTube channels and playlists to learn the basics in less than an hour. Creating a flash course on Notion has been on my to-do list for a while, so you can subscribe to my YouTube channel and be a bit patient for that to come alive.\nIn the first 10 chapters, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn almost everything about Git, and by doing the exercises, you\u0026rsquo;ll gain great confidence in your Git knowledge.\nStarting with chapter 11, you\u0026rsquo;ll get familiar with GitHub. Colt illustrates almost every situation you might face in a real collaborative project. These demonstrations are unique to this course and rarely found in other courses. I suggest taking notes on these scenarios to quickly review the instructions when needed.\nIf you check out the feedback on Udemy, you\u0026rsquo;ll see that many students agree with my opinion on the course.\nFinal Thoughts I can\u0026rsquo;t express enough gratitude to Colt Steele for his amazing zero-to-mastery course. Instead of taking multiple courses on Git, watch this course once patiently, take good notes, and use your notes to master the knowledge.

My primary goal at this stage was to get familiar with the fundamentals.

The course is super rich in content, quite lengthy, and requires proper note-taking and practice. For note-taking, I used Notion, which is my first, second, and third choice for taking notes, including some code snippets. If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with Notion, you can find plenty of YouTube channels and playlists to learn the basics in less than an hour. Creating a flash course on Notion has been on my to-do list for a while, so you can subscribe to my YouTube channel and be a bit patient for that to come alive.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"From Zero to Git Pro - A Review of Colt Steele’s Bootcamp on Udemy"},{"content":"\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve reached the boiling point with the situation.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is an idiom we all use from time to time to express feelings of being overwhelmed, often accompanied by anxiety. However, what I\u0026rsquo;ve been experiencing over the last two days is much more intense. To describe it, I thought it might be fitting to draw on my long-forgotten days of studying chemical engineering. While many people think of the boiling point as the hottest state a substance can experience, every thermodynamics reference explains that the critical point is what we should be looking for. This state is achieved by controlling both pressure and temperature, rendering the substance unidentifiable as a solid, liquid, or gas. In other words, it loses its distinct characteristics.\nSo, \u0026ldquo;at my critical point\u0026rdquo; has been my status for the last two days. I\u0026rsquo;ve been thoroughly reviewing my educational and personal development path since graduating high school. To be honest, not only are the results not in my favor, but I also feel that nowhere along this journey have I felt satisfied, even briefly.\nEverything traces back to when I was about twelve years old, and my father bought us a PC. I was fascinated by this new phenomenon, not for gaming, but for the potential it had to become anything I could imagine. Seeing my passion, my mom enrolled me in a professional course, which I didn\u0026rsquo;t appreciate at the time. Later, I realized it was the MCSE Professional Certification Course by Microsoft. By the time I turned eighteen, my curiosity had given me a solid foundation in the digital world, making computer engineering my priority for undergraduate studies. But then, a turning point occurred: my parents got divorced. My role in the family shifted from needing support and guidance to acting as a mediator, solving problems beyond my mental capacity. Consequently, my priority changed from pursuing my passion to regaining peace of mind and focus.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll put the needle of the compass on the house and find the farthest place from home to live,\u0026rdquo; I told my mom as I revised my university and major preferences.\nThree months later, I was a student in a major I knew nothing about, in a city near the southeast border of the country, which didn\u0026rsquo;t even have proper drinking water. I lacked the courage, and had no truthful friend or mentor to tell me about the option of quitting. So, I stuck to the plan, and day by day, the snowball effect increasingly diverged my ideal path from the one I was on.\nEventually, I got a second chance. I thought changing my major for my master\u0026rsquo;s might help, and due to the experiences and achievements during my bachelor\u0026rsquo;s years, I chose an MBA. Again, I could have pursued my interests by selecting a computer-related field, but without anyone to encourage me, I watched my dreams slip away once more.\nNow, I\u0026rsquo;m twenty years old and at the end of my MBA journey. My interest and passion for computers and programming are stronger than ever. But I\u0026rsquo;m unsure if it\u0026rsquo;s wise to follow my heart for my last chance. The price could be a two-year compulsory military service to enter the job market officially, plus accepting that a decade of my life—the supposed best decade—is wasted and gone, and I must come to terms with this fact.\nFeeling extremely overwhelmed this morning, I googled \u0026ldquo;software developer vs financial analyst.\u0026rdquo; The first result was an outstanding article by an Iranian on the Medium blog of FreeCodeCamp.org. It\u0026rsquo;s rare to find a specific answer to a buried query, but this was one of those times.\nAs Amir explains, he has faced a similar dilemma. In a fair comparison, he might have experienced an even harder situation since his financial studies are more extensive than mine. Yet, he handled it perfectly, following his passion for programming before it was too late. I highly recommend everyone read the entire article. While it\u0026rsquo;s about a finance student turning into a programmer, many people from different fields might resonate with the idea and the aspects discussed regarding programming.\nAmir Ghafouri\u0026rsquo;s contact info:\nAmir\u0026rsquo;s Article on Medium: Click Here I posted this on my blog firstly to promote Amir\u0026rsquo;s amazing content and secondly as a self-reminder of my mistakes and a catalyst for better future steps.\nLet me know your opinion on my story or share a related story of your own in the comments.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/passion-vs.-practicality---my-struggle-between-finance-and-programming/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve reached the boiling point with the situation.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is an idiom we all use from time to time to express feelings of being overwhelmed, often accompanied by anxiety.

For many, this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity is the perfect moment to set new goals and open new chapters in life. Interestingly, so many parents have scheduled the birth of their child to coincide with this day that the government reports a tripling in birth rates!\nAlthough I’ve always preferred Christmas as my goal-setting point on the calendar for personal reasons, Nowruz has prompted me to revisit my bucket list and reorganize my to-dos.\nFrankly, my current life status is nothing to be proud of. As a twenty-eight-year-old Iranian, I am far from the person I hoped to be both personally and professionally. Various aspects of living in Iran have led me to make wrong decisions over the years, and the snowball effect has made any possible turnaround increasingly difficult and costly.\nBut in 2022, I decided to pay the price and break the cycle. Over the past four months, I’ve taken my first steps on professional and psychological paths that bring energy and joy to my life. While the journey has been challenging, passion has made many of the changes and transitions remarkably smooth.\nOn the professional side, I’ve been nurturing my inner programmer for the past four months. For the first time in my life, I don’t feel any pressure pursuing an objective. I have a clear progression plan for the next two to three years, and my energy and thirst for success in this journey will undoubtedly fuel the process.\nI’ve also made significant changes in various aspects of my personal life, which I hope will improve my psychological state in the mid-term. I don’t think there’s much left to lose to OCD, social anxiety, and depression. So, I’m prepared and ambitious to do whatever it takes to help myself out of a life heavily influenced by external factors and not reflective of my true potential.\nIf everything goes as planned, by my 32nd birthday, a much different version of me will be living nearly 70% of his dream life, with a substantial list of accomplishments.\nThis blog post is more of a personal reminder than an announcement of my goals or wishes for the new year. But if there’s anything you’d like to discuss, I’d love to hear from you in the comments section or my inbox.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/welcoming-nowruz-1401-01-01--a-time-for-renewal-and-goals/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"welcoming-nowruz-14010101-a-time-for-renewal-and-goals\"\u003eWelcoming Nowruz 1401/01/01: A Time for Renewal and Goals\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNowruz marks the first day of the first month of the Iranian calendar, and this year is extra special—it’s also the first day of the 15th century on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari\u0026amp;rls=en\u0026amp;sxsrf=APq-WBuKQAw9ZCPm_de--pjE8CNZkx0yuQ:1648742917875\u0026amp;q=Solar+Hijri+calendar\u0026amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLSz9U3yC4zL8grWsQqEpyfk1ik4JGZVZSpkJyYk5qXklgEAHXFr90lAAAA\u0026amp;sa=X\u0026amp;ved=2ahUKEwiIlcj_3fD2AhWRiv0HHSxmCYgQmxMoAXoECCcQAw\"\u003eSolar Hijri calendar\u003c/a\u003e.
