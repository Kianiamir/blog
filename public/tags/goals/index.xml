      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life, at its core, is founded on interdependency. This concept was beautifully articulated by Stephen Covey in his book, <em>Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</em>. I still vividly remember the moments spent reading it. Not just for the sheer joy of it, but because it took me months to finishâ€”I was really slow at reading English back then! ðŸ˜‘ Part of why I liked the content was its resonance with my own experiences; it didn&rsquo;t feel like a new strategy to adopt, but something I had already encountered in life. I fondly recall explaining the book, word by word, to my friend Amin while sitting in Saebâ€™s Garden.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve realized that the discussion on dependency, independency, and interdependency isnâ€™t always clear or relatable to everyone. It&rsquo;s not about complex mathematics or wizardry, but it seems some fundamental aspects of personality might be necessary to grasp these concepts. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m sharing these thoughts here.</p>
<p>Over the years, Iâ€™ve broached this topic with many people. If this were a scientific study, I could almost conclude that hardly anyone cared or understood. Even those initially interested soon lost pace and gave up.</p>
<p>This narrative is indeed sad, but the reason behind it is quite clear: such discussions donâ€™t cater to the lower levels of Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs. Simple, but thereâ€™s more to it. I believe as the economy worsens and peopleâ€™s needs become more immediate, interest in morality-based guidance dwindles. What terrifies me is that as we drift away from moral foundations, achieving high-value individual and societal goals becomes increasingly difficult. We risk trapping our whole community in a detrimental loop. What will happen after two generations? A rich cultural heritage might lose its defining personality traits, and a great nation like Iran could face turmoil similar to what Afghanistan has experienced.</p>
<p>How many years would it take for Afghans to rebuild their country from scratch? Perhaps indefinitely. And what are the prospects for personal growth for the new generations in such a society? Perhaps negligible.</p>
<p>I initially thought about tweeting on this topic, but here I am, having written a whole page instead! ðŸ˜‚ This will remain a public draft until I find the time to add a concluding section, further discussing the dynamic between givers and takers, as classified by Adam Grant.</p>
<p>For now, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0qveRSr-Zk">this clip</a> (Note: the spoken language is Persian). ðŸ˜‡</p>
