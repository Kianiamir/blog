      <title>From Zero to Git Pro - A Review of Colt Steeleâ€™s Bootcamp on Udemy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I decided to learn data science, I started my learning path by diving into Git. My primary goal at this stage was to get familiar with the fundamentals. However, the amazing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-bootcamp/#instructor-1&#34;&gt;bootcamp by Colt Steele&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be much more than I ever imagined, and it&amp;rsquo;s the best programming course I&amp;rsquo;ve ever taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course consists of 20 chapters, and believe me, you won&amp;rsquo;t reach the last part easily. The course is super rich in content, quite lengthy, and requires proper note-taking and practice. For note-taking, I used Notion, which is my first, second, and third choice for taking notes, including some code snippets. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with Notion, you can find plenty of YouTube channels and playlists to learn the basics in less than an hour. Creating a flash course on Notion has been on my to-do list for a while, so you can subscribe to my YouTube channel and be a bit patient for that to come alive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>The course consists of 20 chapters, and believe me, you won&rsquo;t reach the last part easily. The course is super rich in content, quite lengthy, and requires proper note-taking and practice. For note-taking, I used Notion, which is my first, second, and third choice for taking notes, including some code snippets.

Creating a flash course on Notion has been on my to-do list for a while, so you can subscribe to my YouTube channel and be a bit patient for that to come alive.</p>
<p>In the first 10 chapters, you&rsquo;ll learn almost everything about Git, and by doing the exercises, you&rsquo;ll gain great confidence in your Git knowledge.</p>
<p>Starting with chapter 11, you&rsquo;ll get familiar with GitHub. Colt illustrates almost every situation you might face in a real collaborative project. These demonstrations are unique to this course and rarely found in other courses. I suggest taking notes on these scenarios to quickly review the instructions when needed.</p>
<p>If you check out the feedback on Udemy, you&rsquo;ll see that many students agree with my opinion on the course.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<ol>
<li>I can&rsquo;t express enough gratitude to Colt Steele for his amazing zero-to-mastery course.</li>
<li>Instead of taking multiple courses on Git, watch this course once patiently, take good notes, and use your notes to master the knowledge.</li>
