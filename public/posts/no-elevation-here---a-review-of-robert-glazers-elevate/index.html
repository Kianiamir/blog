One day, I found it on sale on the Kindle Store and bought it without checking the rating and reviews on Goodreads. I wish I had!\nRobert Glazer is an award-winning CEO and entrepreneur. His interviews in multiple podcasts and magazines piqued my interest, leading me to believe his book would be equally insightful. Unfortunately, like many self-help books written by successful leaders, I found “Elevate” lacking in novelty and inspiration.\nThe book introduces a 4-principle framework for capacity building:\nSpiritual Capacity Intellectual Capacity Physical Capacity Emotional Capacity Upon skimming through the book and seeing this list, I had a feeling of déjà vu. Apart from a few quotes from notable figures in capacity building and personal growth, I hardly ever felt the urge to highlight anything noteworthy.\nHere’s a brief overview of some key points from the book:\nHighlights Intro\nFor everyone who knows deep down they can be more.\nThis quote initially raised my expectations sky-high. I was ready to add Robert Glazer to my list of personal heroes. He begins with a story about his weekly newsletter, Friday Forward, and its unexpected success, hoping to hook readers for the chapters ahead.\nChapter 1: What Is Capacity Building?\nCapacity building is defined as:\nThe method by which individuals seek, acquire, and develop the skills and abilities to consistently perform at a higher level in pursuit of their innate potential.\nGlazer emphasizes that capacity building is about doing more of the right things, not just more things. He introduces the four elements of capacity building:\nSpiritual (understanding who you are) Intellectual (enhancing your ability to think and learn) Physical (improving your physical performance) Emotional (facing challenges and managing relationships) Glazer believes our growth is best when all four elements develop in tandem.\nChapter 2: Build Your Spiritual Capacity\nDon’t consider the word “Spiritual” as a religious term in the context of capacity building. It refers to understanding who you are and what you want most in life.\nCore values serve as guideposts for navigating life, and understanding them is crucial for growth.\nChapter 3: Build Your Intellectual Capacity\n“Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young.” —Henry Ford\nIntellectual capacity involves the ability to learn, plan, and execute with discipline. Improving this capacity starts with the belief that it can be improved.\nChapter 4: Build Your Physical Capacity\nGlazer discusses the importance of a healthy body on overall life quality, emphasizing good nutrition and sleep.\nChapter 5: Build Your Emotional Capacity\nThink about a race car. If your spiritual, physical, and intellectual capacities are the tools to design, build, and improve the car, your emotional capacity is your ability to drive it amidst other drivers and unexpected obstacles.\nHe underscores the importance of challenging oneself, gratitude, and maintaining meaningful relationships.\nChapter 6: Build A Better Path\nNothing particularly noteworthy was found in this chapter.\nEach chapter ends with an action plan for practical steps in capacity building. You might find these useful if you’re curious about specific techniques.\nMy Personal Conclusion: I gave this book a rating of 1 out of 5 because it failed to offer anything new or interesting. However, this might be due to my previous readings and high expectations from an author of Glazer’s caliber.\n","wordCount":"560","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2023-07-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Amir Kiani"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/no-elevation-here---a-review-of-robert-glazers-elevate/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Amir Kiani's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
