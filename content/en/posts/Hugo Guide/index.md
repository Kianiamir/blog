Why am I spending time presenting this instruction? Because using the official wikis of Hugo and your theme of choice (PaperMod in my case) might not be as straightforward for beginners.

## Installation

I'm using macOS. For installation instructions on other operating systems, check the [Hugo installation page](https://gohugo.io/installation/).

To install Hugo on macOS, I use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install hugo
```

## Creating Your Site

I like my site to be stored in a directory called `blog`, but feel free to change the name as you wish:

```bash
hugo new site blog
```

Now that the directory is created, initiate a git repository in it:

```bash
cd blog
git init
```

## Choosing and Installing a Theme

Hugo is installed, and now you need a theme. Choose one by searching through the web; my choice is PaperMod. You'll need the GitHub link of the theme.

To create the site with a YAML configuration file (since PaperMod uses YAML):

```bash
hugo new site blog --format yaml
```

Note that if you follow the instructions in Hugo's official GitHub wiki, the config file will be generated as a TOML file instead of YAML. You have to force the usage of YAML because the sample files of the theme are in YAML format and using them is a good starting point.

To install the theme:

```bash
git submodule add --depth=1 https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod
```

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive # needed when you reclone your repo (submodules may not get cloned automatically)
```

```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

Finally, set the theme as PaperMod in your site config. In `hugo.yml` add:

```yaml
theme: ["PaperMod"]
```

## Configuration

Here are the sample configurations to be added to `hugo.yml` for a quick start:

```yaml
baseURL: "https://examplesite.com/"

## Running Your Site Locally

Now everything is set up. You can run your website locally and check the blank index page. In the terminal:

```bash
hugo server
```

Then open this link in your browser:

```text
localhost:1313
```

## Adding Content

To add posts, you can add `.md` files to the content directory or simply use this command as suggested by the official Hugo wiki:

```bash
hugo new content/posts/my-first-post.md
```

But before doing so, I highly suggest checking the archetype folder and the `default.md` file. One issue I noticed is that the default header for new content is in TOML while we forced the site to use YAML universally. This might not necessarily cause problems, but I prefer consistency throughout the files. My `default.md` file was like this:

```toml
+++
title = '{{ replace .File.ContentBaseName "-" " " | title }}'
date = {{ .Date }}
draft = true
+++
```

I changed it to this:

```yaml
---
title: '{{ replace .File.ContentBaseName "-" " " | title }}'
date: {{ .Date }}
draft: true
---
```

Now you are more than ready to create new content:

```bash
hugo new content/posts/my-first-post.md
```

At this point, you have a fully functional site that works fine locally. For the next steps, you can host it on a server to make it accessible to everyone. Happy blogging!
