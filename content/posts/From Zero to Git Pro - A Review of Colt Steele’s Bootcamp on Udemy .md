When I decided to learn data science, I started my learning path by diving into Git. My primary goal at this stage was to get familiar with the fundamentals. However, the amazing [bootcamp by Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-bootcamp/#instructor-1) turned out to be much more than I ever imagined, and it's the best programming course I've ever taken.

The course consists of 20 chapters, and believe me, you won't reach the last part easily. The course is super rich in content, quite lengthy, and requires proper note-taking and practice. For note-taking, I used Notion, which is my first, second, and third choice for taking notes, including some code snippets. If you're not familiar with Notion, you can find plenty of YouTube channels and playlists to learn the basics in less than an hour. Creating a flash course on Notion has been on my to-do list for a while, so you can subscribe to my YouTube channel and be a bit patient for that to come alive.

In the first 10 chapters, you'll learn almost everything about Git, and by doing the exercises, you'll gain great confidence in your Git knowledge.

Starting with chapter 11, you'll get familiar with GitHub. Colt illustrates almost every situation you might face in a real collaborative project. These demonstrations are unique to this course and rarely found in other courses. I suggest taking notes on these scenarios to quickly review the instructions when needed.

If you check out the feedback on Udemy, you'll see that many students agree with my opinion on the course.

## Final Thoughts

1. I can't express enough gratitude to Colt Steele for his amazing zero-to-mastery course.
2. Instead of taking multiple courses on Git, watch this course once patiently, take good notes, and use your notes to master the knowledge.
